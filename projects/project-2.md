Dratini is a recent compilation of short instrumentals that I released on the music sharing platform SoundCloud. The instrumentals
consist of various arrangements, including synthesizers, recorded instruments, drums, and sampled audio. The tracks are also mixed and
mastered by me, for which I used different elements of audio design, such as compression, equalization (EQ), reverberation, waveform
manipulation, and many more.

Making the songs has been a personal endeavour, and in making them I have learned alot about audio design, as well as how the VST files 
software work to create the sounds that they do. This has caused me to be interested in developing Music making software, like the
plugins that I use.

Making the songs and artwork for them is fun, and making the artwork has also taught me a little bit about graphic design. I plan to
explore that field more as well, because I feel it is not only an important skill for sharing art, but also for promoting a business
or website. The SoundCloud continues to be updated with new songs as I am able to produce them.
