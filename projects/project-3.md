summary: A small company I formed with other students as a Junior Achievement program.
---
Emerge was a company I formed with other students my sophomore year of high school. We sold small, eco-friendly jewelry like bracelets and
necklaces. The products were locally sourced, and represented cultural elements of our home island of Guam. 

My department was production, although I also played a big role in marketing. For the production crew, we analyzed and executed the most
efficient and effective production strategies, to ensure we could match the demand for our customers while turning a profit. As for the
marketing responsibilites, I directed the commercial that we released, and led the design for the company logo.

On this project I learned what it takes to make a business succeed, because while we worked well as a team, there were important mistakes
that we learned from to apply to future endeavours. Companies need teams that are punctual, reliable, and indiviually capable, because when
tasks arise they should be dealt with immediately and exceptionally.
