You've been here a million times. You've got some code to commit in about 8 hours and it's crunch-time; if you don't finish now your
entire career and reputation will be all but dust. Everything is going fine until you reach that one bug, that one stubborn compilation
error that just won't vanish. You cry out in anguish, frantic to find any solution to your problem. Like anyone else stuck between a
rock and a hard place, you turn to the Internet, that almighty bibliotheca of instant gratification. "Oh my god!! How do I solve
this!!1! Help!" is the title of your query on StackExchange - surely that will get a response, right? Wrong, and by the end of this
essay, you'll see why.

## Well what's wrong with that?

The community that you are asking for help are largely volunteers. StackExchange does not monetize the forums for people who answer
questions, so you're running on their personal time. Everything about your post needs to be concise, obvious, and appreciative. In
addition to these, the most important quality of them all is that it appears as though YOU committed as much time the problem as you
expect someone else to. So a half-a$$ed, pathetic question is more likely to piss off a potential answerer than anything.

## I didn't know that though, what's a good example of how I should post?

I'll show you. Open the linke below in a new tab, split the screen, and behold a post which exemplifies the qualities of a good
question, and a good answer. 

[Great Example Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51848999/collatz-conjecture-python-incorrect-output-above-2-trillion-only)

Here's why this is so good. First, the title obviously communicates the objective, the problem, and the platform. Just from the title
you know what tool/software is having the problem, what the user is generally trying to do but cannot do because they encountered the
problem, and, you probably guessed it by now, THE PROBLEM. It's crazy how many posts are some variation of "Help!!". Looking at the post
itself, the OP provides source code, a list of solutions that he's tried, and an open attitude to criticism of his shortcomings. When he
comes back to update the post, he does so clearly, and effectively. All of these facets lead to a beautiful answer, one that is also
detailed and pleasant. This exchange is one of the best you can find, and a golden example of how asking smart questions leads to smart
answers.

## Hmmm, ok, can you give me an example of what I shouldn't do?

Absolutely. Go ahead and close that other tab, and pop this one up side by side to see what the problem is.

[Get ready...](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52215209/feature-creation-cucumber-tests)

Unless it has changed since the time of me publishing this essay, our poor friend here has gotten 0 answers. I'm sure you can see why.
The title is uninformative and vague, yet oddly and esoterically confusing at the same time. The question is worse; it honestly sounds
like he's just asking "how do I code this thing I have to code?". Even if that is what he's asking, he has provided no resources, no
context, and no list of solutions he already tried. This post is pretty much spam, and will be treated as such by anyone looking to
answer questions. Whether its a lack of awareness or a language barrier, I sure hope that our friend here gets that problem solved, or
at least figures out the right way to ask someone for help in solving it.

## I see. I think I'm ready to start asking smarter questions!

Great! Smarter questions == Smarter answers == completed projects == money. So, go on ahead, use what you've learned to master the help
forums of the internet. Always research and try a few things yourself first, and when you absolutely need to reach it, make it as easy
for people to help you as humanly possible, because inconveniencing someone on their free time means no answer. Good luck, and happy
forum searching!
