You've been here a million times. You've got some code to commit in about 8 hours and it's crunch-time; if you don't finish now your entire
career and reputation will be all but dust. Everything is going fine until you reach that one bug, that one stubborn compilation error
that just won't vanish. You cry out in anguish, frantic to find any solution to your problem. Like anyone else stuck between a rock and a
hard place, you turn to the Internet, that almighty bibliotheca of instant gratification. "Oh my god!! How do I solve this!!1! Help!" is
the title of your query on StackExchange - surely that will get a response, right? Wrong, and by the end of this essay, you'll see why.

## Well what's wrong with that?

The community that you are asking for help are largely volunteers. StackExchange does not monetize the forums for people who answer
questions, so you're running on their personal time. Everything about your post needs to be concise, obvious, and appreciative. In addition
to these, the most important quality of them all is that it appears as though YOU committed as much time the problem as you expect someone
else to. So a half-a$$ed, pathetic question is more likely to piss off a potential answerer than anything.

## I didn't know that though, what's a good example of how I should post?

I'll show you. Behold a post which exemplifies the qualities of a good question, and a good answer.
