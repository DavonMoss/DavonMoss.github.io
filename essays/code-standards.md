Yes the title is a barely related pun. Yes this is an informative essay.

Amateur comedy aside, coding standards are an integral part of software engineering - almost if not just as important as the syntax and
algorithms that run the code itself. This isn't because of anything related to the computer; for all it cares you can mash in an
incomprehensible mess of spaghetti code, the CPU only cares about the 1's and 0's it becomes. Instead, coding standards are essential
to modern software engineering because of the human component. The pyramids weren't built by one man, and neither were any of the
quintessential enterprise software that we use everyday. When teams of people are working on a project, having an established 'language'
between the lines of your code means that your finished product will come out gorgeous and polished, and it'll be wholly evident.
