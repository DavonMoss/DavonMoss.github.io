Every now and then, we programmers get sick and tired of nudging things a little the left or a little to the right, pixel by pixel.
Code is great, but alot of projects have similar requirements, and as a result have similar solutions. Within programming problems
exist sets of operations that you need to perform over and over again, and that is why frameworks exist. Frameworks and APIs are giant
libraries of code, which wrap the repetitive code that we hate to write into short, 1 - 3 line phrases that make our lives easier, and
our code standard. Overall, frameworks are incredibly useful for reducing friction in software development, and enforcing a standard
library so that adding to a given project is easier.

## You have to learn a brand new language almost! How are frameworks worth the trouble?

They do require a little extra reading, but most frameworks, especially Semantic UI, make that reading clear and available. Their 
documentation is often well organized and designed, and in many cases is created to teach. Lots of frameworks are made with the
intention of being usable from reading the website alone, without the need to watch a long and most likely uninteresting tutorial.
So, because it's so easy to get into and it's hard to fail with all the guidance in the documentation, the massive benefits:
standardization, convenience, and guided design, make it undoubtedly worth the work.

## Do you have experience with any frameworks?

Yes. As a result of this class, we learned how to use Semantic UI, a framework for making HTML/CSS websites much easier to write.
It transforms long drawn out chains of obscure and esoteric keywords into obvious, 'human' lines. Someone who doesn't even code could
look at 'ui red borderless menu' could tell that that's referencing a UI thing, that is red, has no borders, and is a menu. I've worked
with other framework/APIs, like Unity C# and OpenGL, and while some are tougher than others (OpenGL...), these libraries of code make
creating the applications I'm trying to create a possibility.

## In conclusion...

Frameworks are good. Writing everything from sketch is bad. The end.
