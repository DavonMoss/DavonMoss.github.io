I breathe in the fresh, cool air as I step out of the hell-cavern known as ICS212: C/C++. I've been away from the real world for so long - 
the IDE is a familiar yet foreign tool, as I've grown accustomed to fighting my battles in the command line, with vim. Passersby and old 
friends shout to me, speaking of a legend I had heard before but never explored. "Javascript," they cry out, "learn Javascript!" 
Directionless and weak, broken and cynical, I stumbled up the hill to that promised land. Now that I have arrived, I don't know that I'll 
ever leave.

Javascript is unique. Perhaps I say that for lack of knowledge of that great pantheon of programming languages, but still, it feels 
different to me. It's a language that feels fun to code in, that feels natural and alive. Not that C and Java aren't great, they have 
their ups and downs, but Javascript takes the form of a living, breathing, intelligent programming companion. I would say this is due in
great part to the lack of strong-typing, a feature that allows the language to have much less friction than C and Java. For example, it 
makes a program like this:

```JavaScript

function (input)
{
  let retVal = 0;

  if(input === "foo")
  {
    retVal = "bar";
  }
  else
  {
    retVal += 24;
  }
  
  return retVal;
}

```
