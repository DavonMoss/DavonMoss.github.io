## Overview
PROBLEM: Lots of students want to make sure that the downtime they have between classes, work, and homework 
is spent wisely, since they don't have alot of it. Students also might be interested in talking to other 
students about similar interests, via some method that would let them connect to people they wouldn't have
met otherwise.
SOLUTION: "Reccommender (not final name)" is a site that allows users to post short reviews and hold 
discussions on categorized topics like 'Movie/TV', 'Music', 'Resturaunts', etc. It is a one stop shop for
the student body's thoughts on what to do in Oahu, or on the internet. 

## Mockup Ideas
Landing page with highest rated item in each category displayed, User page with favorites, reviews, and etc.
listed, all-time top page, admin home page, reviews are displayed in cards with ratings, price, convenience,
tips, how many people should do it etc. displayed as content

## Use Case ideas
User hits landing page and wants to search only, not discuss.
User want to create account to discuss/create reviews.
User wants to go to link of reccommended activity.
User wants to comment on review.

## Beyond the Basics
Send users reccommendations and connect them with services based on the things they check out.
